# Solar-System-Sim

Authors: C. Hohne, J. Gutierrez, J. Woychuk
Project Overview: This project displays a top-down graphical simulation for the solar system with all nine planets and the Earthâ€™s moon. When the mouse hovers over an
object of interest, a tooltip with the name of the object and a couple quick facts about it is displayed. Classes CelestialBody and Planet are used to make objects that are displayed in a window using Raylib. Pressing the spacebar stops or starts the animation.
